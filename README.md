# EarthquakeWarning
Android version of EarthquakeWarning Application.

It's a good example that shows how to use phone's GPS to find user's current location and show it on the Map (GoogleMap is used), also i used "Pushe.co" Service for receiving push notfications whenever an earthquake happens. The data related to earthquakes are compelety random for now, the app has another version for "Sending" data to server and create fake earthquakes for testing purposes.
